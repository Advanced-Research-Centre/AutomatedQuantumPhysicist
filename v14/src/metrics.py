	Bures distance between two density matrices
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bures_metric
	Bures metric or Helstrom metric defines an infinitesimal distance between density matrix operators defining quantum states. 
	It is a quantum generalization of the Fisher information metric, and is identical to the Fubiniâ€“Study metric when restricted to the pure states alone.
