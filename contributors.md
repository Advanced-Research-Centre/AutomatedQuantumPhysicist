The QKSA project was started as part of the PhD research of [Aritra Sarkar](https://qutech.nl/person/aritra-sarkar/) at Delft University of Technology.

### QWorld QIntern2021

Based on the QKSA, Aritra mentored a team of interns in the [QIntern2021](https://qworld.net/qintern-2021/) programme organized by [QWorld](https://qworld.net/) from 1st Jul to 22nd Aug 2021.

QIntern2021 project name: *Reinforcement Learning Agent for Quantum Foundations*

The developments from the QIntern program are available at [this GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/qworld/qresearch/qintern2021/QKSA_QIntern).

The list of participating interns in the various sub-projects are:
* SP_survey: Tamal Acharya; Muhammad Usaid; Prachi Agrawal
* SP_alife (quine hypervisor): Dhanvanth Balakrishnan
* SP_games (tic-tac-toe): Santanu Banerjee; Soham Bopardikar
* SP_cworld (grid navigation): Siddharth Golecha
* SP_clogic (Boolean logic learning): Bao Bach; Burak UÃ§ar
* SP_least (Pebbling game and E-metric): Sarang Gosavi
* SP_qThought: Swaraj Purohit; Prateek Jain; Kashish Goel
* SP_QKSAs (multi-agent QPT): Arnav Arora; Parv Bharagva
* SP_QP (qiskit open circuit): Chow Wain Sein (aka) Aung Hein; Suraj Pratap; Kaushal Kishor Gagan; Alvaro Rafael Gomez

### QWorld Research Project

Some promising developments from the QIntern2021 are being continued as an open collaborative [research project](https://qworld.net/research-projects/) under QWorld.

The list of sub-projects and qualifying requirements are:
* *General environments*: Extend QKSA's environment definition to include probabilistic circuits and measurements. Open to participants of SP_QP.
* *Quine hypervisor*: Automate quine generation, analytics and multi-threading. Open to participants of SP_alife.
* *Complexity geometry of classical algorithms*: Visualize classical version of Nielsen geometry. Open to participants of SP_survey and SP_clogic.
* *Thermodynamics of algorithmic complexity*: Extend Thermodynamics of Turing Machines to general Python programs. Open to participants of SP_least.
* *Quantum swarm intelligence*: Survey of problems and methods. Open to participants of SP_qThought and SP_QKSAs.

### Q&CE Research

QKSA project is part of the research within the [Department of Quantum & Computer Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering) at TU Delft.

The list of collaborators are:
* *Interns*: Harshitta Gandhi
* *Supervisors*: Dr. Zaid Al-Ars; Dr. Koen L.M. Bertels
